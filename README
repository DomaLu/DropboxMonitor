Use this script if your Dropbox folder is installed on a removable disk.


The launch agent watches the /Volumes folder for any changes
and launches the bash script to start / stop Dropbox

1. Configure the plist file with the volume name of the removable disk.
2. Install com.ech3n.dropbox-monitor.plist file in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
3. Install toggle-dropbox.sh in ~/Users/username/bin/

To load the launch agent:
    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ech3n.dropbox-monitor.plist
    
To unload the launch agent:
    launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ech3n.dropbox-monitor.plist
